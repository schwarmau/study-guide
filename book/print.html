<h1><a class="header" href="#asymptotic-analysis" id="asymptotic-analysis">Asymptotic Analysis</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#big-o-notation" id="big-o-notation">Big-O Notation</a></h2>
<p>Asymptotic analysis is usually expressed in Big-O notation. This notation is usually used to describe the upper bound on a growth rate.</p>
<p>Formally, it is said that \( f(x) = O(g(x)) \) if there exists a positive real number \( m \) such that \( \left\lvert f(x) \right\rvert \leq m \cdot g(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \). Alternatively, \( f(x) = O(g(x)) \) if such an \( m \) exists that makes \( \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\left\lvert f(x) \right\rvert}{m \cdot g(x)} \lt \infty \) true.</p>
<p>For example: \( x^2 \) is \( O\left(x^3\right) \) and \( 4x^2 + 3x + 2 \) is \( O\left(x^2\right) \).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#other-notations" id="other-notations">Other Notations</a></h2>
<p>Big-\( \Omega \) notation can be interpreted as the &quot;opposite&quot; of Big-O notation in computer science; \( f(x) = \Omega(g(x)) \) if and only if \( g(x) = O(f(x)) \). Alternatively, \( f(x) = \Omega(g(x)) \) if there exists a positive real number \( m \) such that \( \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{m \cdot g(x)} \gt 0 \).</p>
<p>For example: \( x^3 \) is \( \Omega\left(8x^2\right) \). It is also possible for the second example above to hold: \( 4x^2 + 3x + 2 \) is \( \Omega\left(x^2\right) \).</p>
<p>Big-\( \Theta \) notation is defined simply as: \( f(x) = \Theta(g(x)) \) if and only if \( f(x) = O(g(x)) = \Omega(g(x)) \).</p>
<p>Using the example above: \( 4x^2 + 3x + 2 \) is \( \Theta\left(x^2\right) \).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#algorithm-analysis" id="algorithm-analysis">Algorithm Analysis</a></h2>
<p>In computer science, Big-O notation is commonly used to describe the performance of algorithms, either in terms of run time or memory usage. Usually when run time or memory usage are analyzed, we want to know the worst-case, so we make the assumption that conditional statements always pass. Take the following function for example:</p>
<pre><code>def myFunc(someArray)
{
    count = 0;

    foreach (element in someArray)
    {
        if (element != null)
            count = count + 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Line-by-line:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>count = 0;</code> is an assignment operation, and has a constant run time, so this is an \( O(1) \) operation.</li>
<li><code>foreach (element in someArray)</code> loops through each element of the array, so this tells us that whatever happens inside this loop will happen n times, where n is the length of the array.</li>
<li><code>if (element != null)</code> is a conditional statement (constant time) using an equality comparer (also constant time), thus an \( O(1) \) operation.</li>
<li><code>count = count + 1;</code> is an assignment and increment (both constant time). Since we're analyzing the worst case scenario, we assume this will always be hit, even though it's only conditionally hit in practice. Either way, it is an \( O(1) \) operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, we have a run time of \( O(1) + (O(n) \cdot (O(1) + O(1))) \). This can be condensed to \( O(1 + (n \cdot (1 + 1))) = O(1 + n) = O(n) \).</p>
<p>If we were to add another for loop inside the existing one then we would get a runtime of \( O\left(n^2\right) \), and so on.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#amortized-analysis" id="amortized-analysis">Amortized Analysis</a></h3>
<p>An alternative to worst-case performance analysis is amortized analysis, which is roughly &quot;average-case&quot; performance analysis. There are 3 primary methods to analyze an algorithm like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the algorithm \( n \) times with different inputs, calculating their operational costs each time. Take the upper bound of the sum of all operational costs and divide by \( n \).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_method_(computer_science)">The accounting method</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_method">The potential method</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Amortized analysis is usually how certain performance gains are found, especially when the possible input set of an algorithm is limited. For example, quick sort is the most commonly implemented sorting algorithm, but it's actually faster to sort a mostly sorted collection using insertion sort. Similarly, quick sort in and of itself has a worst-case of \( O(n) \), even though it's <em>usually</em> more performant than other sorting algorithms with better worst-case analyses.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-master-theorem" id="the-master-theorem">The Master Theorem</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to analyze algorithms, especially when they implement recursion, such as in Divide &amp; Conquer algorithms. This is where the master theorem comes into play. Divide &amp; Conquer algorithms can be expressed as \[ T(n) = a \cdot T\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n) \] where \( T(n) \) is an upper bound on the run time of the algorithm, \( n \) is the input size, \( a \) is the number of recursive calls that each individual call makes, \( \frac{n}{b} \) is the input size of the recursive calls, and \( f(n) \) is the the run time of the final call (the base case). Additionally, let \( c_{crit} = \frac{\log(number of subproblems)}{\log(relative subproblem size)} = \log_b a \).</p>
<p>Given the above, the master theorem says that</p>

<h4><a class="header" href="#graphs" id="graphs">Graphs</a></h4>
<p>There aren't that many types of graphs, and the most common non-standard type is a flow network.</p>
<p>Graphs can be searched in \( O(\left\lvert V \right\rvert + \left\lvert E \right\rvert) \) time using \( O(\left\lvert V \right\rvert) \) space, where \( \left\lvert V \right\rvert \) and \( \left\lvert E \right\rvert \) are the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.</p>
<p>The performance of finding the shortest path between two vertices depends on the type of graph (directed, acyclic, does/does not contain negative edge weights, etc.) and the algorithm used. See more in the algorithms chapter.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#linear-data-structures" id="linear-data-structures">Linear Data Structures</a></h1>
<h3><a class="header" href="#dynamic-array" id="dynamic-array">Dynamic Array</a></h3>
<p>This is array that can shrink or expand in size. A somewhat basic implementation of this is creating a new array with length of, for example: 16. When the array becomes full, a new array is created with more spaces (different implementations may create a different amount of spaces), for example: 32. Then, all the values in the old array are copied into the new array. The same operation may happen in reverse if enough values are deleted from the array.</p>
<p>The average cost to insert or delete at a random index is therefore \( \Theta(1) \), but to insert or delete at the beginning or end of the array is \( O(n) \). Dynamic arrays usually waste \( \Omega(n) \) space when expanding.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#hashed-array-tree" id="hashed-array-tree">Hashed Array Tree</a></h3>
<p>Despite the name, this is not really a tree; It's a dynamic array. The difference is that elements are stored as lists. </p>
<p>For example, your base array may start with a capacity of 16. Actually, it would be an array of length 4, where each element is a pointer to another array of length 4. </p>
<p>This approach puts some restrictions on when it can be expanded and shrunk, but it means that you only have to move 4 elements (the pointers) instead of 16 when you do expand it. The insertion and deletion performance of the hashed array tree is therefore the same as in a standard dynamic array, but it only wastes \( O\left(\sqrt n\right) \) space when expanding.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#singularly-linked-list" id="singularly-linked-list">Singularly Linked List</a></h3>
<p>A list that consists of a sequence of nodes, which each contain a value and a reference to the next node in the list (or null if it is the last node).</p>
<ul>
<li>Searchable in \( O(n) \) time (unsorted). Variable when sorted (depends on algorithm).</li>
<li>Reading, inserting or deleting at the end of the list may take \( O(1) \) or \( O(n) \) time, depending on whether the last element is known or not (it is known in most implementations).</li>
<li>Reading, inserting or deleting at the beginning of the list should take \( O(1) \) time.</li>
<li>Insert, delete, or read in the middle of the list in <em>search time</em> + \( \Theta(1) \) (always \( O(i) \) time if acting on index \( i \ne n-1 \)).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#doubly-linked-list" id="doubly-linked-list">Doubly Linked List</a></h3>
<p>The main difference between a doubly linked list and a singularly linked list is that nodes also carry a reference to the previous node. This may lend itself to sorting algorithms, and if the last element is known in the implementation, then it will always take at most \( O\left(\frac n 2 \right) \) time to read/insert/delete at a specific index (time is still that of a singularly linked list if looking for an element by value instead of index).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#circularly-linked-list" id="circularly-linked-list">Circularly Linked List</a></h3>
<p>A circularly linked list is simply a linked list where the &quot;next&quot; pointer of the last node points to the first node. There is no substantial performance difference between this and a singularly linked list. A circularly linked list can optionally be implemented with doubly linked nodes, thus gaining the benefits of a doubly linked list.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#skip-list" id="skip-list">Skip List</a></h3>
<p>A skip list is quite a unique list. It is a tiered structure, where each tier is itself a sorted list (commonly a linked list). At the top you have a list with few elements, and as you progress down, the lists gain more and more elements (including the elements from previous tiers). Usually there is some sort of algorithm to determine which elements go in the top tier (usually the most frequently accessed elements end up there). This kind of data structure is known as a probabilistic data structure.</p>
<p>A search through a skip list would start at the top and work its way down when it cannot find the desired element. It goes through elements until it passes from a smaller element to a larger element than the one desired, then it will go down to the next tier and search between those two elements in the that tier, and so on. To go to a specific position it can simply jump to the bottom tier or, if it knows the highest tier that the index is on, it can jump straight to the highest tier with that index.</p>
<p>This kind of list is good for storing data with values of varying importance, such as data following a normal curve.</p>
<p>To achieve the performance benefits of a skip list, you must accept wasted space. A skip list will use \( O(n \log n) \) space in the worst case, but \( O(n) \) on average in exchange for searching, inserting, and deleting in \( O (\log n) \) time on average and \( O(n) \) time in the worst case.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#hash-table" id="hash-table">Hash Table</a></h3>
<p>An implementation of an associative array that passes provided keys through a hash function to determine where in an array they go.</p>
<p>Key collisions can be handled either by implementing the array as an array of lists (multiple keys can map to the same place, but their order is tracked so as to know which value in the list belongs to which key) or by moving the value to the next available space.</p>
<p>Hash tables...</p>
<ul>
<li>do not allow for null keys or values.</li>
<li>are thread-safe, but not performant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hash tables will use the standard \( O(n) \) space with constant time (\( O(1) \)) searches, insertions, and deletions on average (\( O(n) \) in the worst case).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#hash-map" id="hash-map">Hash Map</a></h3>
<p>This is a volatile variation of the hash table, which...</p>
<ul>
<li>allows nulls for keys and values.</li>
<li>is not thread-safe, but is performant.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#hash-set" id="hash-set">Hash Set</a></h3>
<p>A set in which values are passed through a hash function to determine their placement within an array. All other rules of sets are followed (unique, unordered values).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#graphs-1" id="graphs-1">Graphs</a></h1>
<p>Graphs are collections of vertices (a.k.a. nodes) and edges, where each vertex has a collection of edges it touches, and each edge is composed of a <em>to</em> vertex and a <em>from</em> vertex. They are primarily used for spatial operations or relationship analysis.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#directed-graph" id="directed-graph">Directed Graph</a></h3>
<p>Edges can only be traversed one way. Vertices have their collection of edges split in two: one collection for incoming edges and one collection for outgoing edges.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#directed-acyclic-graph" id="directed-acyclic-graph">Directed, Acyclic Graph</a></h3>
<p>Directed graphs are acyclic if there is no way to traverse from any one vertex back to itself.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#flow-networks" id="flow-networks">Flow Networks</a></h3>
<p>Edges in a flow network are assigned a flow, and each vertex must have the same incoming flow as it has outgoing flow, except for source vertices, which may not have any incoming flow, and sink vertices, which may not have any outgoing flow. Edges are assigned a capacity, and the flow through edges cannot exceed their capacity.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#adjacency-list" id="adjacency-list">Adjacency List</a></h3>
<p>This is a way of representing a graph as a list of node adjacencies.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#trees-1" id="trees-1">Trees</a></h1>
<p>Trees are basically rooted graphs (interactions with trees begins at the same vertex each time, which is the root).</p>
<p>Some terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>An element is referred to as a <em>node</em>.</li>
<li>The starting node, with no parent, is called the <em>root</em>.</li>
<li><em>External nodes</em>, or <em>leaves</em> are the nodes with no children. <em>Internal nodes</em> are the opposite.</li>
<li>The <em>height</em> of a tree is the length of the longest path to a leaf from the root.</li>
<li>A tree is <em>balanced</em> if the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>All trees listed below use \( O(n) \) space.</p>
<p>Trees can have very complex implementations, so the implementations will not all be described here. The important part is knowing which trees are important for which tasks; You can always google the implementation once you know what you need.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#binary-tree" id="binary-tree">Binary Tree</a></h3>
<p>In a binary tree, no node can have more than two child nodes. This leads to some handy properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum number of nodes at level \( l \) will be \( 2^{l-1} \). Note: The root node is considered to be on level 1.</li>
<li>The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height \( h \) is \( 2^h - 1 \). Note: The height of a tree with one node (the root node) is considered to be 1.</li>
<li>In a binary tree with \( n \) nodes, the minimum height is \( \log_2(n+1) \).</li>
</ul>
<p>Many correlaries can be drawn from the aforementioned properties as well.</p>
<p>There are various ways of describing binary trees based on their structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>full</strong> binary tree is one in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. Recursively: A full binary tree is either a single node, or a node with 2 children that are each full binary trees.</li>
<li>A <strong>complete</strong> binary tree is one in which every level except the last must be completely filled, and all nodes on the last level must be as far left as possible.</li>
<li>A <strong>perfect</strong> binary tree is one in which all leaves are on the same level.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#binary-search-tree" id="binary-search-tree">Binary Search Tree</a></h3>
<p>The basic process of inserting into a binary search tree is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>insert(value)
{
    if root.value == null
        root.value = value
    else if value &lt;= root.value
        root.left.insert(value)
    else
        root.right.insert(value)
}
</code></pre>
<p>The expected height of a binary search tree is \( \sqrt n \).</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take, on average, \( O(\log n) \) time and, at worst, \( O(n) \) time.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#avl-tree" id="avl-tree">AVL Tree</a></h3>
<p>In an AVL tree, the nodes are ordered, from left to right, minimum to maximum, and the tree stays as balanced as possible.</p>
<p>The basic process of inserting is similar to that of a binary search tree, except that after an insertion, the ancestors of the new node are checked for balance and, if they are not balanced, they get re-balanced.</p>
<p>AVL trees are similar to red-black trees in terms of operational performance, but AVL trees are faster for lookup-intensive applications because they are more strictly balanced.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take \( O(\log n) \) time.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#splay-tree" id="splay-tree">Splay Tree</a></h3>
<p>Splay trees can really use whatever ordering they want, but the important part is that there is an order, because splay trees have the unique behavior of &quot;splaying&quot; once a node is accessed. Splaying enacts a series of rotations/swaps with the accessed node and its parent or siblings, repeatedly, until the accessed node becomes the root node and the tree still adheres to its ordering principle. This means that splay trees are very performant when it is known that some nodes will be need to be accessed much more frequently than others.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take, on average, \( O(\log n) \) time and, at worst, \( O(n) \) time.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#trie" id="trie">Trie</a></h3>
<p>What makes a tree a trie is if all nodes have a key that is some character to accompany its value. Thus, a traversal through a trie results in a path that creates a unique word/string out of the keys. This also makes it an associative array implementation.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take \( O(m) \) time, where \( m \) is the length of the word/string being accessed or updated.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#cartesian-tree" id="cartesian-tree">Cartesian Tree</a></h3>
<p>Cartesian trees are heap-ordered (largest values on top, smallest at bottom, or vice-versa) trees generated from a sequence of numbers (each node represents one of the numbers in the sequence) with the unique property that a symmetric (in-order/left-to-right) traversal of the tree will yield the sequence it was generated from. It takes linear time to construct such a tree.</p>
<p>These trees are commonly used for range-searching operations and range minimum queries.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take, on average, \( O(\log n) \) time and, at worst, \( O(n) \) time.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#k-d-tree" id="k-d-tree">K-D Tree</a></h3>
<p>Every leaf node in a k-d tree represents a k-dimensional point. Each level down the tree splits that point on another dimension. </p>
<p>For example, in a 2-d tree, the root node may represent a 1-dimensional line with the formula \( y = x \). In this tree, every leaf node to the left of the root will represent a point \( (x,y) \) where \( y \lt x \), and every leaf node to the right of it will represent a point where \( y \gt x \). You could keep creating divisions at each level until eventually you make leaf nodes with the actual coordinates of the points.</p>
<p>This type of tree lends itself to range-searching operations and nearest neighbor problems.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take, on average, \( O(\log n) \) time and, at worst, \( O(n) \) time.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#red-black-tree" id="red-black-tree">Red-Black Tree</a></h3>
<p>In a red-black tree, each node is assigned a color (red or black), and the tree is given a pattern. If that pattern gets broken by an insertion or deletion, then the tree is re-arranged to reform the pattern of colors. Usually the rule is that colors must alternate.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take \( O(\log n) \) time.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#b-tree" id="b-tree">B-Tree</a></h3>
<p>A B-tree is a non-binary tree that stores nodes in groups and remains balanced. Instead of a node having children, groups of nodes have shared children. This is used for databases and file systems since it is well-suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take \( O(\log n) \) time.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#van-emde-boas-tree" id="van-emde-boas-tree">Van Emde Boas Tree</a></h3>
<p>A unique tree that implements an associative array, whose search time improves as the stored values decrease in bit size.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take \( O(\log m) \) time, \( m \) is the bit length of the keys, and the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the tree is \( 2^m \).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#radix-tree" id="radix-tree">Radix Tree</a></h3>
<p>A radix tree is a type of trie which is space-optimized. Each node that is an only child is merged with its parent, so instead of a path like g-l-a-d-i-a-t-o-r, you may get a path like g-l-adi-a-to-r.</p>
<p>These share the performance of tries, with some optimizations on searching and some taxes on inserting/deleting.</p>
<p>Searching, inserting, and deleting all take \( O(m) \) time, where \( m \) is the length of the word/string being accessed or updated.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#heap" id="heap">Heap</a></h3>
<p>Heaps are types of trees that are commonly used to implement priority queues. Heaps are almost <em>complete</em> trees, and usually they either sort by low-to-high or high-to-low from top-to-bottom.</p>
<p>Some common operations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find-Min (find the highest priority node)</li>
<li>Delete-Min (delete the highest priority node)</li>
<li>Insert</li>
<li>Increase-Key/Decrease-Key (update the priority of a key/node in the tree)</li>
<li>Meld/Merge (join 2 heaps together)</li>
<li>Heapify (turn a list of elements into a heap)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#binary-heap" id="binary-heap">Binary Heap</a></h3>
<p>These are simply heaps wherein nodes can only have 2 children.</p>
<p>Finding takes \( \Theta(1) \) time, deleting \( \Theta(\log n) \), inserting and modifying the key \( O(\log n) \), and melding/merging \( \Theta(n) \).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#fibonacci-heap" id="fibonacci-heap">Fibonacci Heap</a></h3>
<p>A fibonacci heap is actually a collection of heap-ordered trees, which maintains its status as a heap by keeping track of the minimum value between all the trees. The sizes of the trees are limited by the fibonacci numbers, hence the name. A fibonacci heap is guaranteed to be more performant than a binary heap in cases where insertions and modifications are more likely to happen than deletions.</p>
<p>Finding, inserting, modifying, and merging should all take \( \Theta(1) \) time, with deletions taking \( O(\log n) \).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#algorithms" id="algorithms">Algorithms</a></h1>
<p>Algorithms are essentially a way of getting from point A to point B. Therefore, many of the algorithms in this section will be accompanied by some sort of problem or question that the algorithm solves or answers.</p>
<p>In practice, it is unlikely that you will face the exact problems that these algorithms solve, but it's worth knowing them because many problems can be transformed into problems that these algorithms solve. This is the concept behind NP-Hard; A problem is said to be NP-Hard if any problem in NP can be transformed into it in polynomial time. In order to solve an NP-Hard problem, you simply need to know an NP problem, the solution to it, and how to transform it into the NP-Hard problem. The same can philosophy can be extended indefinitely to other, real-world problems, and is not confined to NP-Hard (just because a problem is not NP-Hard does not mean you cannot transform it into another problem you know the answer to).</p>
<p>As with data structures, this chapter only covers algorithms that are significant/well-known in computer science, or that are broadly applicable to most computer science fields. This means, for example, you wont find an algorithm for analyzing pictures of people to determine if they are smiling or frowning, nor will you find algorithms specific to artificial intelligence, meachine learning, etc. This chapter includes, primarily, algorithms that are applicable to most fields of computer science or have some value outside of niche use cases.</p>
<p>Ultimately, just knowing algorithms wont help <em>that</em> much. Here are some places where you can practice applying your knowledge of algorithms:</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#top-level" id="top-level">Top-Level</a></h1>
<p>Top-level algorithms encompass the general approaches to solving problems in computer science. These don't necessarily have an accompanying problem, and they're used as a foundational piece of most common algorithms.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#brute-force" id="brute-force">Brute Force</a></h3>
<p>The most straight-forward approach to problem-solving: Try everything. Many people think of password cracking when they think of brute force algorithms; If you are trying to figure out the passcode to a 4-digit combination lock with no guess limit, you can simply try every combination of 4 digits. Such is the essence of brute force.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#greedy-method" id="greedy-method">Greedy Method</a></h3>
<p>The greedy method is when you &quot;prefer&quot; something in an algorithmic approach to problem solving. </p>
<p>For instance, if you want to maximize the number of items you can take on your trip in your suitcase without concern for their value, you might pack your items in order from smallest to largest. In that case, you are preferring small items, so you're using a greedy method. Such a problem also demonstrates the drawback of the greedy method: Often times, it is not perfect. In that scenario, at some point it may no longer becomes optimal to pack the smallest item because its shape might prevent you from adding anything more, even though 2 slightly larger items would have fit.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#divide--conquer" id="divide--conquer">Divide &amp; Conquer</a></h3>
<p>Like the name suggests, the premise of divide and conquer algorithms is to divide the problem into sub-problems, solve the sub-problems, and then merge the solutions together to form the solution to the initial problem.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#dynamic-programming" id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</a></h3>
<p>Dynamic programming can be difficult to conceptualize, but don't worry, there are examples in other sections of this guide. </p>
<p>Similar to the divide and conquer approach, dynamic programming seeks to define sub-problems and solve them before merging them to create a solution to the base problem. The difference between the two approaches is that dynamic programming requires that the sub-problems are overlapping. </p>
<p>So what, exactly, is an overlapping sub-problem? Consider the Fibonacci series: \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \), with the base case \( F_1 = F_2 = 1 \). In order to solve for \( F_{10} \) we generate two sub-problems, \( F_{10} = F_9 + F_8 \). We thus need to solve another sub-problem, \( F_9 = F_8 + F_7 \), and so we see that the solution for \( F_{10} \) and \( F_9 \) have an overlapping sub-problem of \( F_8 \) (and \( F_7 \), etc.). If we were to take a divide and conquer approach then we'd be solving \( F _8 \) twice, which dynamic programming seeks to optimize against.</p>
<p>The dynamic programming approach is usually to create a k-dimensional table for sub-problems and their solutions, where k is the number of sub-problems each problem has. There are 2 common ways to go about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top-down: Upon observing a sub-problem, check the table to see if it has already been solved. If it has already been solved, then use it, otherwise we solve it and add its solutin to the table.</li>
<li>Bottom-up: Create a table of sub-problems, then start at the most refined sub-problem(s) (one which does not have any further sub-problems, like \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) in the Fibonacci series), adding solutions to the table until you arrive at the original problem. </li>
</ul>
<p>The top-down approach may save more space, but you have to check the table for a sub-problem in each iteration. The bottom-up approach avoids the lookup tax, but might solve more sub-problems than it needs to. The top-down approach is usually done recursively, whereas the bottom-up approach is usually done iteratively. In programming this amounts to whether a function calls itself or whether it uses a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#cap-theorem" id="cap-theorem">CAP Theorem</a></h2>
<p>It is impossible for a distributed data store to guarantee more than 2 of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency: Every read gets the most recent write (or an error).</li>
<li>Availability: Every request receives a non-error response.</li>
<li>Partition Tolerance: The system will function regardless of time delay or dropped messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is implied that a data store with network partitioning will therefore have to choose between consistency and availability.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#acid-transactions" id="acid-transactions">ACID Transactions</a></h2>
<p>An ACID transaction is one which satisfies the following 4 characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity: Each transaction, regardless of how complex, will either completely succeed or completely fail, so there are no partial updates to the data store.</li>
<li>Consistency: Transactions can only bring the database from one valid state to another.</li>
<li>Isolation: Transactions processed concurrently are guaranteed to have the same end result as if they were processed sequentially.</li>
<li>Durability: Once a transaction has been committed it will remain committed, regardless of system availability (i.e. data is stored in non-volatile memory).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the difference between the &quot;consistency&quot; of an acid transaction and &quot;consistency&quot; in the CAP theorem.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#base-models" id="base-models">BASE Models</a></h2>

<li>Soft State: Consistency of data is delegated to developers instead of being handled by the database.</li>
<li>Eventual Consistency: At some point, data will converge to a consistent state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;eventual consistency&quot; clause need only be proven theoretically.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#joins" id="joins">Joins</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, a join is an operation that combines data from two tables in a relational database management system. In practice though, many NoSQL environments can accommodate joins in some form, even if it is not built-in functionality.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#inner-join" id="inner-join">Inner Join</a></h3>
<p><strong>Common Syntax</strong>: <code>SELECT Employee.Name, Department.Name FROM Employees AS Employee INNER JOIN Departments AS Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.DepartmentId</code>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Combines rows in the Employees table with rows in the Departments table that have the same DepartmentId, ignoring nulls and rows with no match.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#left-outer-join" id="left-outer-join">Left Outer Join</a></h3>
<p><strong>Common Syntax</strong>: <code>SELECT Employee.Name, Department.Name FROM Employees AS Employee LEFT OUTER JOIN Departments AS Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.DepartmentId</code>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Combines rows in the Employees table with rows in the Departments table that have the same DepartmentId. It will keep all rows in the Employees table, and if there is no matching row in the Departments table it will use null for the Department values (Department.Name in this case). It will still ignore nulls and rows with no match from the Departments table.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#right-outer-join" id="right-outer-join">Right Outer Join</a></h3>
<p><strong>Common Syntax</strong>: <code>SELECT Employee.Name, Department.Name FROM Employees AS Employee RIGHT OUTER JOIN Departments AS Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.DepartmentId</code>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Combines rows in the Departments table with rows in the Employees table that have the same DepartmentId. It will keep all rows in the Departments table, and if there is no matching row in the Employees table it will use null for the Employee values (Employee.Name in this case). It will still ignore nulls and rows with no match from the Employees table. This is not a common join since it is equivalent to a Left Outer Join where the FROM and JOIN tables are swapped.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#full-outer-join" id="full-outer-join">Full Outer Join</a></h3>
<p><strong>Common Syntax</strong>: <code>SELECT Employee.Name, Department.Name FROM Employees AS Employee FULL OUTER JOIN Departments AS Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.DepartmentId</code>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Produces the union of a Left Outer Join and a Right Outer Join (all rows from both tables will be accounted for, and nulls will be inserted where matches weren't found).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#cross-join-aka-cartesian-join" id="cross-join-aka-cartesian-join">Cross Join (A.K.A. Cartesian Join)</a></h3>
<p><strong>Common Syntax</strong>: <code>SELECT Employee.Name, Department.Name FROM Employees AS Employee CROSS JOIN Departments AS Department</code>
<strong>Effect</strong>: Produces the cartesian product of the two tables. A new row will be created for every combination of rows between the two tables.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#deciding-what-to-use" id="deciding-what-to-use">Deciding What To Use</a></h2>
<p>So the lingering question is, &quot;When do I use NoSQL, and when do I use SQL?&quot; Well, in general, NoSQL is simply more flexible, and can be used in pretty much any situation. Most of the benefits of SQL are things that can be emulated for NoSQL within the calling code, but that does add complexity. Additionally, in the modern development environment, you can use different databases for different tasks, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Here are some things to look for that might indicate SQL being better for your use case:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to accommodate a wide array of complex queries that combine results across different subdomains in your application (e.g. for generating reports).</li>
<li>You need to ensure ACID compliance (e.g. for financial applications).</li>
<li>You don't anticipate a lot of changes or growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might instead look into using NoSQL in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have budget restrictions (SQL is more expensive to scale).</li>
<li>The data structures being managed are volatile/variable.</li>
<li>You plan to analyze large amounts of data, but don't need to manipulate/write data in such quantities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other, more specific use cases for NoSQL include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event capture and processing.</li>
<li>Storing data for intelligence engines to use.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#relational-databases" id="relational-databases">Relational Databases</a></h1>
<p>Relational data stores are the ones most people are comfortable with. They can be categorized by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is stored as relationships, in tabular form, usually representing an entity type.</li>
<li>Robust support for joins.</li>
<li>Requirement of ACID transactions.</li>
<li>Out-of-the-box support for relational algebra (including aforementioned joins).</li>
</ul>
<p>A core aspect of designing relational databases is the normalization of data. That is: The process of structuring a relational database to reduce redundancies in the data and improve data integrity. Normalization is an incremental process, and the varying degrees of normalization are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>1NF (First Normal Form): Each column of a table must be atomic (contain non-separable values, such as strings, integers, and dates, but not lists). To achieve this, you can usually split the non-atomic columns into their own tables and use a key to relate them to the original table.</li>
<li>2NF (Second Normal Form): Each non-key attribute (column) must be dependent on the whole table key (not just part of it). To achieve this, you can usually move a part of the key and its dependencies to a new table.</li>
<li>3NF (Third Normal Form): Non-key attributes in the table are exclusively dependent on the key. In other words: No non-key attribute should depend on another non-key attribute. This can usually be achieved by moving the non-key attribute in question to a new table where its dependency is a key.</li>
<li>BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): Each attribute represents a fact about &quot;the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key&quot;. This is often fixed by moving the attribute in question to a new table with only the parts of the original table's key that it cares about. This is an intermediary step between 3NF and 4NF but came about after 4NF, which is why it itself is not 4NF.</li>
<li>4NF (Fourth Normal Form): Every multi-value dependency (2+ values) is either trivial (every {x, y, ...} combination is unique in the table for that relationship) or the independent key in the dependency is a candidate key (only exists once in the table). This is best demonstrated with an example: Suppose you have a table with a key {Restaurant Name, Pizza Type, Delivery Area}. In this example pizza type and delivery area both depend on the restaurant, but do not depend on each other, so it can be split into two tables, one with a {Restaurant Name, Delivery Area} key, and one with a {Restaurant Name, Pizza Type} key.</li>
<li>5NF (Fifth Normal Form): Every non-trivial join relationship is implied by the keys in the table. You can verify 5NF by trying to split a table into new tables and then joining the split tables together. If there is no way to split the original table in a way that the new tables can be joined together to look identical to the original table, then that table satisfies 5NF.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are actually other normal forms, but they are more nuanced and not as frequently followed.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#nosql" id="nosql">NoSQL</a></h1>
<p>NoSQL databases are exactly what their title claims they are: non-SQL databases. The hallmarks of a NoSQL database are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data storage is flexible by virtue of not being tied to relationships.</li>
<li>Adherance to the BASE model.</li>
<li>Efficient implementations of partitioning, clustering, etc. for distribution of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike relational systems, which are commonly designed around the entities and normalization of data (relationships are handled later via joins), NoSQL databases are commonly designed with runtime queries in mind. Stores might be created specifically for one query, and there may be redundancies across stores for that reason. Often, redundancies can be avoided, but sometimes they can't be in the name of performance.</p>
<p>There are many NoSQL data stores to choose from, but the most common ones fall under one of these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key-Value: These act like dictionaries; They tie a key to a value. These are good for straight-forward lookups.</li>
<li>Document: Document stores are a dubclass of Key-Value stores wherein all the data is contained in a document, which could have any structure desired (similar to objects in programming). Documents in a database usually do not need to have matching schema. The data in key-value stores are inherently opaque to the database, whereas a document store relies on the internal structure of the document to extract metadata that the database engine can use to optimize transactions. This difference is usually moot.</li>
<li>Columnar: Columnar data stores store data in columns instead of rows. Traditional, row-based storage will serialize complete records together (e.g. for a &quot;Person&quot; with a &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Age&quot;, you might see <code>John Smith, 30</code> and <code>Daisy Hopkins, 29</code> as the rows), whereas a columnar storage will serialize complete columns together (for the previous example: <code>Record 1: John Smith, Record 2: Daisy Hopkins</code> and <code>Record 1: 30, Record 2: 29</code>). The traditional, row-based storage lends itself to drawing relationships between tables, but for simple queries, the columnar store will be much more performant.</li>
<li>Graph: Graphs store data...in a graph! This adds a layer of relationships to objects in the store, making it useful for storing information about networks and groups, as well as lending itself to pathfinding queries.</li>

<p>In addition to the questions covered in this chapter, which can generally be studied via flash cards and practice, here are some general interviewing tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update your personal website (don't have one? make one)</li>
<li>Update any professional social media profiles (e.g. LinkedIn)</li>
<li>Update your resume (create a copy specifically for the position/company you're applying to) and CV</li>
<li>Research the company</li>
<li>Write a cover letter and send it either with your resume or after you submit your resume (you can look up what to write, there are many examples online)</li>
<li>If the interview is planned more than a week in advance, it may be a good idea to write a confirmation letter to the interviewer a day or two before the interview. For example:
&gt;I'm writing to confirm our meeting for Thursday at 9:30 AM. I look forward to discussing my application for the software engineering position at [Company Name]. Please contact me if you have any last-minute questions or comments.</li>
<li>Bring a clean notepad and pen, copies of your resume, a list of references (if not included on resume), ID and Social Security card (in case you're asked to complete an application on the spot)</li>
<li>Write down the name of your interviewer(s) and the position and company you are interviewing for beforehand if you think you might forget any of those</li>
<li>Turn off your phone for the interview</li>
<li>Write a followup letter after the interview (next day) (you can look up what to write, there are many examples online)</li>

<p>If possible, connect your skills directly to a problem the company has, and describe how you can solve it.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#what-are-your-greatest-strengths" id="what-are-your-greatest-strengths">What are your greatest strengths?</a></h3>
<p>Brag about yourself, but make it relevant to the position.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#what-are-your-greatest-weaknesses" id="what-are-your-greatest-weaknesses">What are your greatest weaknesses?</a></h3>
<p>Your &quot;weaknesses&quot; should actually be strengths, but phrased like something you want to improve upon.</p>
<p>Sometimes I like to include a bit about how I've improved myself based on peer/supervisor feedback to demonstrate a drive to improve. Doing so requires a bit more honesty, since you probably wont get feedback about &quot;weaknesses that aren't really weaknesses&quot; from your coworkers, so I don't do this with managerial interviewers, but I might throw it in when I'm interviewing with people that would be peers if I got the job.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What about the project was challenging? / What challenges did you face on the project?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What did you learn from the project?</strong></li>

<p>Pick a story where you're the hero if possible. If you aren't specifically asked to talk about how the project helped you grow, you should still talk about it anyways.</p>

<p>Whatever the real reason is, just say you're looking for &quot;greener pastures&quot; (i.e. a place to grow and expand your horizons). If you were to trash talk your old office it would make you look like a gossiper, and while there are other inoffensive and legitimate reasons to want to leave a job, none will likely sound as good as saying you want to grow as a professional and that you couldn't continue to do so at your old/current job.</p>

<p>These are question that will test your knowledge of the trade and your problem solving skills.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#short-answer" id="short-answer">Short Answer</a></h1>
<p>Note: In addition to what is provided here, you may be asked questions about anything you have put on your resume (e.g. How does X work in the Y programming language?).</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is \( 2^x \)? Note: \( x \) will rarely be more than 12.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between a struct and a class, and what might you use a struct for? Note: This is somewhat language-dependent (not all languages even have both).</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Structs usually give their properties and methods public modifiers by default, and in some modern languages they represent value types as opposed to reference types. Usually structs are used for simple objects or types, which don't need complex methods. In general, a struct might be appropriate when the data type is going to be small, and either it is expected to be short-lived or it is expected to be frequently embedded in other objects.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is a static class/method/variable?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Class: A static class is one which cannot be instantiated.</li>
<li>Method: A static method is one which is not tied to an instance of an object.</li>
<li>Variable: A static variable is one which is shared across instances of an object.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do the 'public', 'protected', 'private', and 'internal' keywords denote?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> These keywords refer to the accessibility of their subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public: Anyone can access this from anywhere.</li>
<li>Protected: When present in languages, it usually means only child classes can access this, and they can do so from anywhere.</li>
<li>Private: Only this object can access this.</li>
<li>Internal: When present in languages, it usually means anyone can access this, but only from within this package/library.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does being immutable entail, and what keywords can modify mutability?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If something is immutable then it cannot be changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 'const' keyword can make its subject immutable at compile time (in addition to being static).</li>
<li>The 'readonly', when present in a language, can make its subject immutable at run time. Its value can still only be set once, and usually only in the constructor of a class.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does the 'final' keyword denote?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> When present in a language, it prevents a class or method from being inherited or overriden, respectively.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is idempotence?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A function is said to be idempotent if repeated function calls with the same input will only change the state of the state of the application once.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example: getting a value and setting a value are idempotent, the end result is always the same after the first call is made, regardless of repetition. However, adding to a list is not idempotent, because repeated calls to add will keep modifying the list further.</li>
<li>In mathematical terms, a function \( f \) is idempotent if \( f o f = f \).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is lazy bind/loading?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Waiting until a resource is needed before you bind/load it.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is reflection?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Code's ability to inspect itself or other code in the same program.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the 4 pillars of object-oriented design?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Abstraction: The process of showing only the necessary features of an object to other code.</li>
<li>Inheritance: The ability to make a hierarchy of classes wherein child classes acquire certain properties and behaviors of parent classes.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: The ability of a child class to both share and extend the properties and behavior of a parent class.</li>
<li>Encapsulation: The process of wrapping properties and behavior in an object so that access to each property and function can be controlled, and so that properties and behavior can be related to each other.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What's the difference between inheriting and interfacing?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Inheritance defines what an object is, whereas interfacing defines what an object can do.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is a pure function?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A function with no side-effects that always returns the same output for a given input.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is NP-Completeness?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A problem is said to be NP if it has a non-deterministic polynomial-time solution, and a problem is said to be NP-Hard if every NP problem can be transformed into it in polynomial time. For a problem to be NP-Complete means that it is both NP and NP-Hard.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is a lock/mutex?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A mechanism for controlling access to a resource. Unlike semaphores, only one task can gain access to a lock/mutex at a time in order to access the resource.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is a semaphore?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A variable used to signal the availability of a resource. Unlike locks/mutexes, a semaphore can allow multiple tasks to access a resource; a semaphore value of 0 indicates that no other tasks are allowed access to the resource, and a value of more than 0 allows that many more tasks to access the resource. Consequently, a binary semaphore (a semaphore only allowed to be 0 or 1) can be used to implement a lock/mutex.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#whiteboard" id="whiteboard">Whiteboard</a></h1>
<p>Competitive tech companies are notorious for giving computer science applicants a barrage of whiteboard problems. The thing that distinguishes these problems from other common interview problems is their long form and focus on critical thinking, as opposed to rote memorization. These come in the form of &quot;here's what you know, here's what you want to know, write an algorithm to find out what you want to know.&quot; You probably wont be given a computer, you probably wont be allowed to use your phone, and you probably wont be given a piece of paper; It's just you and a whiteboard.</p>
<p>Even if you're well-acquainted with the algorithms chapter you may still find these problems difficult, but there are some steps you can take alleviate the challenge and impress the interviewer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the inputs, outputs, requirements, and constraints. 
<ul>
<li>Ask the interviewer about these if you are unsure.</li>
<li>Usually you aren't given the method signature of the solution. Instead, the question might be simply, &quot;Given a list of people, sort them by age&quot;. Here, you can ask questions like, &quot;What should a person object look like?&quot; (they might just have you create it to see what you come up with). Such questions can apply to outputs as well. Even better, you could ask, &quot;Can I assume that the maximum age of a person is 150?&quot; That question could be the difference between implementing quick sort and implementing bucket sort.</li>
<li>Common requirements and constraints might revolve around runtime, complexity, memory usage, etc. It's likely that you wont receive such requirements/constraints if they are not mentioned by the interviewer. However, if you solve the problem quickly, they may try to expand upon the question by asking you to solve it under certain constraints or with certain requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think out loud. Interviewers want to hear your thought process, and sometimes they might correct your course if they can tell you're going down the wrong path.</li>
<li>Don't try to write syntactically correct programs (unless asked). Write pseudo-code. It's faster, and you reduce the risk of syntactical errors ruining your solution.</li>
<li>If you can't think of a solution immediately, then start by trying to recall any algorithms that might solve the problem with a little transformation. A well-known example of this is the bipartite matching problem, which can be transformed into a maximum flow problem, which has a known algorithmic solution.</li>
<li>If you can't recall an algorithm that matches this problem, then pick a top-level algorithm and design a new algorithm yourself (refresher: top-level algorithms include brute force, divide &amp; conquer, greedy method, and dynamic programming).</li>
<li>Don't forget about recursion. Interviewers seem to love recursion. If you can solve a problem in a simple way with recursion, do it!</li>
<li>Address all possible inputs. Usually edge cases can be solved with simple <code>if</code> statements, so it can be beneficial to address them last if time is a concern.
<ul>
<li>Remember: negatives, zeros, positives, minimums, maximums. Aside from those, it's situational (e.g. if using division with a variable denominator, you need to check that the denominator can never be 0).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you solve a problem quickly, and you notice that there are places in the solution that an exception could be thrown if it were converted to real code on a machine, then you might sound smarter if you ask if you should handle possible exceptions. This is rarely encountered, and rarely a requirement, just something to keep in mind if you breezed through the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#questions-to-ask" id="questions-to-ask">Questions To Ask</a></h1>
<p>When it's your turn to ask questions, I've come up with some good (in my opinion) ones. While it's true that <em>having</em> questions might make you look better, it probably doesn't matter much what the questions are, so unlike the other pages, this one isn't meant to be a guide or wiki.</p>
<p>Note: Questions about salary, benefits, etc. should be saved for after you've been offered the job. This is not a resource for negotiation tactics, although such resources do exist.</p>
<p>Note: If the answer to any of these questions is available on the company's website or was included in the job description, then don't ask it; It might just make you look worse for not knowing what you're applying for.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What software development workflows and frameworks do you use?
<br>
<i>Workflows = tools, procedures, etc.</i>
<br>
<i>Frameworks = waterfall, agile, scrum, etc.</i></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What sorts of projects could I expect to be a part of if I were to work here?</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are parts of the job that you enjoy? (Alternatively: What's your favorite part of working here?)
<br>
<i>Not applicable to interviewers who are not in the position you're applying for...</i></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does a typical work day look like for you?
<br>
<i>Again: probably not relevant to ask people who aren't in the position you're applying for...</i></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What technology stacks do you use?</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are some challenges that might be faced by someone just starting to work here?</p>
