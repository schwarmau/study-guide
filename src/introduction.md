# Introduction

Welcome. You've found my study guide. With the help of some friends I've created a guide encapsulating most of the knowledge I've found necessary for interviews in my personal experience, as well as things I've learned may be necessary from a variety of books related to software engineering interviews.

Beyond interview prep, this can also be a good reference for anyone in school trying to study for their data structures, algorithms, or design patterns courses.
