# Personal/Anecdotal Questions

Your goal when answering any of these questions is basically to talk about how amazing you are without sounding bragadocious.

In addition to the below, common questions, anything on your resume is fair game; if you talked about specific projects on your resume, you should be prepared to answer questions about them.

### Why are you interested in this position?

Talk about you, and mention how passionate/enthusiastic you are about this position.

### What makes you a good fit for this position?

If possible, connect your skills directly to a problem the company has, and describe how you can solve it.

### What are your greatest strengths?

Brag about yourself, but make it relevant to the position.

### What are your greatest weaknesses?

Your "weaknesses" should actually be strengths, but phrased like something you want to improve upon.

Sometimes I like to include a bit about how I've improved myself based on peer/supervisor feedback to demonstrate a drive to improve. Doing so requires a bit more honesty, since you probably wont get feedback about "weaknesses that aren't really weaknesses" from your coworkers, so I don't do this with managerial interviewers, but I might throw it in when I'm interviewing with people that would be peers if I got the job.

### How would you handle a dispute with a co-worker?

Generic answer: compromise.

### Think of a project you worked on...
- **What about the project was challenging? / What challenges did you face on the project?**
- **What was an obstacle that you faced while working on the project, and how did you overcome it?**
- **What did you learn from the project?**

Pick a story where you're the hero if possible. If you aren't specifically asked to talk about how the project helped you grow, you should still talk about it anyways.

### What made you want to leave your previous/current job?

Whatever the real reason is, just say you're looking for "greener pastures" (i.e. a place to grow and expand your horizons). If you were to trash talk your old office it would make you look like a gossiper, and while there are other inoffensive and legitimate reasons to want to leave a job, none will likely sound as good as saying you want to grow as a professional and that you couldn't continue to do so at your old/current job.
