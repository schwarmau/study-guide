# Personal/Anecdotal Questions

Your goal when answering any of these questions is basically to talk about how amazing you are without sounding bragadocious.

In addition to the below, common questions, anything on your resume is fair game; if you talked about specific projects on your resume, you should be prepared to answer questions about them.

### Why are you interested in this position?

Talk about you, and mention how passionate/enthusiastic you are about this position.

### What makes you a good fit for this position?

If possible, connect your skills directly to a problem the company has, and describe how you can solve it.

### What are your greatest strengths?

Brag about yourself, but make it relevant to the position.

### What are your greatest weaknesses?

Your "weaknesses" should actually be strengths, but phrased like something you want to improve upon.

Sometimes I like to include a bit about how I've improved myself based on peer/supervisor feedback to demonstrate a drive to improve. Doing so requires a bit more honesty, since you probably wont get feedback about "weaknesses that aren't really weaknesses" from your coworkers, so I don't do this with managerial interviewers, but I might throw it in when I'm interviewing with people that would be peers if I got the job. Also, you might specifically get a question about what kind of criticism you've had from coworkers, in which case it's probably best to be honest but choose the least bad piece of criticism you've received.

### How would you handle a dispute with a co-worker?

Generic answer: compromise.

### Think of a project you worked on...
- **What about the project was challenging? / What challenges did you face on the project?**
- **What was an obstacle that you faced while working on the project, and how did you overcome it?**
- **What did you learn from the project?**

Pick a story where you're the hero if possible. If you aren't specifically asked to talk about how the project helped you grow, you should still talk about it anyways.

### What made you want to leave your previous/current job?

Whatever the real reason is, just say you're looking for "greener pastures" (i.e. a place to grow and expand your horizons). If you were to trash talk your old office it would make you look like a gossiper, and while there are other inoffensive and legitimate reasons to want to leave a job, none will likely sound as good as saying you want to grow as a professional and that you couldn't continue to do so at your old/current job.

### What would you change/improve about your previous/current job?

This is a hard question to prepare for. You don't want to trash talk your old workplace for the reasons mentioned above, or lie about a weakness in your old company that doesn't exist, and you also don't want to propose a change that highlights a potential weakness in the company you're applying to. A good example would be upward movement: many small companies don't have programs to elevate your position, whereas larger companies do, so if you're leaving a small company and applying to a big one you could say that. Long story short: bring up an honest disadvantage of your previous job, and mention a way to improve it that is already implemented at the company you're applying to.

### Do you think GPA an accurate representation of work ethic?

Don't take a side, even if your GPA is awesome or garbage. Say that the two might be/probably are correlated, but a good GPA doesn't necessarily indicate a good work ethic.

### What's your opinion of [political/religious topic]

Regardless of your opinion, lie if necessary and take a middle road stance. Questions about politics and religion have no place in an interview, and is even illegal in many places. You may be within your rights to sue the company if you don't get the job since and it seems like it could have been a result of this question. Even if you get the job, the kind of place that asks this question probably isn't the kind you should be working for.

### What are your hobbies outside of work?

Be honest, but pick your most attractive hobbies from a professional's perspective. Playing video games isn't really an attractive hobby. Any hobby in which you make something (whether it's coding or not) would be good to include on your list.
