# Personal/Anecdotal Questions

Your goal when answering any of these questions is basically to talk about how amazing you are without sounding bragadocious.

### Why are you interested in this position?

Talk about you, and mention how passionate/enthusiastic you are about this position.

### What makes you a good fit for this position?

If possible, connect your skills directly to a problem the company has, and describe how you can solve it.

### What are your greatest strengths?

Brag about yourself, but make it relevant to the position.

### What are your greatest weaknesses?

Your "weaknesses" should actually be strengths, but phrased like something you want to improve upon.<br>
You could include a bit about receiving feedback from a co-worker/supervisor and improving yourself as a result.

### How would you handle a dispute with a co-worker?

Generic answer: compromise.

### Think of a project you worked on...
- **What about the project was challenging? / What challenges did you face on the project?**
- **What was an obstacle that you faced while working on the project, and how did you overcome it?**
- **What did you learn from the project?**

Pick a story where you're the hero if possible. If you aren't specifically asked to talk about how the project helped you grow, you should still talk about it anyways.

In addition to the above, common questions, anything on your resume is fair game; if you talked about specific projects on your resume, you should be prepared to answer questions about them.
