# Interview Prep

In addition to the types of things in this section, which can generally be studied via flash cards and practice, you should also try to improve your outreach ahead of interviewing:
- Update your personal website (don't have one? make one)
- Update any professional social media profiles (e.g. LinkedIn)
- Update your resume (create a copy specifically for the position you're applying to) and CV
- Research the company
- Write a cover letter and send it either with your resume or after you submit your resume (you can look up what to write, there are many examples online)
- If the interview is planned more than a week in advance, it may be a good idea to write a confirmation letter to the interviewer a day or two before the interview. For example:
>I'm writing to confirm our meeting for Thursday at 9:30 AM. I look forward to discussing my application for the software engineering position at [Company Name]. Please contact me if you have any last-minute questions or comments.
- Bring a clean notepad and pen, copies of your resume, a list of references (if not included on resume), ID and Social Security card (in case you're asked to complete an application on the spot)
- Write down the name of your interviewer and the position and company you are interviewing for beforehand if you think you might forget any of those
- Turn off your phone for the interview
- Write a followup letter after the interview (next day) (you can look up what to write, there are many examples online)
