# Questions To Ask

When it's your turn to ask questions, I've come up with some good (in my opinion) ones. While it's true that _having_ questions might make you look better, it probably doesn't matter much what the questions are, so unlike the other pages, this one isn't meant to be a guide or wiki.

Note: Questions about salary, benefits, etc. should be saved for after you've been offered the job. This is not a resource for negotiation tactics, although such resources do exist.

Note: If the answer to any of these questions is available on the company's website or was included in the job description, then don't ask it; It might just make you look worse for not knowing what you're applying for.

__Q:__ What software development workflow/framework do you use?

__Q:__ What sorts of projects could I expect to be a part of if I were to work here?

<br>

__Q:__ What are parts of the job that you enjoy? (Alternatively: What's your favorite part of working here?)
<br>
Not applicable to interviewers who are not in the position you're applying for...

<br>

__Q:__ What does a typical work day look like for you?
<br>
Again: probably not relevant to ask people who aren't in the position you're applying for...

<br>

__Q:__ What technology stacks do you use?

<br>

__Q:__ What are some challenges that might be faced by someone just starting to work here?
