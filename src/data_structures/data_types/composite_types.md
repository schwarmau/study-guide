# Composite Types

A.K.A. non-primitive types.

Somewhat depends on the language, but this is the list Wikipedia uses.

### Array 

Fixed set of values in adjacent space.

E.G. string (an array of characters).

Indexable in constant (\\( \Theta(1) \\)) time with no wasted space. An index \\( i \\) can be modified in constant time as well. Since the length is fixed, insertion and deletion operations don't apply.

### Record

A.K.A. tuple or structure (struct).

### Union

Can have any of several representations or formats within the same position in memory.
