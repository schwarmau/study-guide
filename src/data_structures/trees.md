# Trees

Trees are basically rooted graphs (interactions with trees begins at the same vertex each time, which is the root).

Some terminology:
- An element is referred to as a *node*.
- The starting node, with no parent, is called the *root*.
- *External nodes*, or *leaves* are the nodes with no children. *Internal nodes* are the opposite.
- The *height* of a tree is the length of the longest path to a leaf from the root.
- A tree is *balanced* if the difference between the height and the shortest path to a leaf from the root is no greater than 1.
